## Week 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Project Title : Kids Screen Time Analysis – Data Foundation Phase

Dataset: screentime.csv

## Objective of Week 1

The objective of Week 1 is to establish a strong data foundation by understanding the dataset structure, quality, and basic patterns. This phase focuses on exploration and analysis, not data modification or cleaning.

## Tasks Completed
1. Dataset Loading

Dataset successfully loaded using pandas

Verified file integrity and structure

2. Dataset Structure Analysis

Checked number of rows and columns

Inspected column names

Understood dataset dimensionality

3. Schema & Data Type Analysis

Identified numerical features

Identified categorical features

Verified boolean and float fields

Validated schema consistency

4. Data Quality Assessment

Missing value detection

Missing value percentage calculation

Duplicate record detection

5. Statistical Profiling

Generated descriptive statistics for numerical columns

Analyzed central tendency and data spread

6. Univariate Analysis

Distribution of daily screen time

Age distribution

Device usage distribution

Gender distribution

7. Bivariate Analysis

Screen time vs Gender

Screen time vs Age

Screen time vs Location (Urban/Rural)

Screen time vs Device

Screen time vs Health Impacts

Screen time vs Recommended Limit

8. Multivariate Analysis

Device-wise screen time comparison by location

## Feature Classification

## Key Observations

Dataset contains 9712 records and 8 features

Data includes both behavioral and demographic attributes

Majority of columns are complete

Health_Impacts column contains missing values

Duplicate records were detected and removed

Screen time distribution shows variability among users

Device usage varies significantly across users

Urban and rural usage patterns show distinct behavior

Multi-factor relationships exist between age, device, location, and screen time
